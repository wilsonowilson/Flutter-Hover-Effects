# Flutter Hover Effects

A collection of CSS inspired Hover Effects for Flutter. These work on both Desktop and Web. 
A few widgets and elements which do not work on the web unfortunately, like ShaderMask, and BlendMode.srcOut. 
The web version is also significantly less performant than the desktop version.
